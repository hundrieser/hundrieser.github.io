I find it fascinating to mathematically describe statistical problems in order to obtain novel insights, but I also enjoy mathematics for its own sake. 

As a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate, fortunate to being supervised by  <a href="http://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=14&username=munk"><b>Axel Munk</b></a>, I have built a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, which has fueled my passion for exploring cutting-edge frontiers of mathematical data science and machine learning. 
My current research focuses on the intricate fields of statistical optimal transport and statistics for non-Euclidean spaces. 
As part of my theoretical efforts, I have also devised refined methods for climate analysis, showcasing my ability to drive innovation and offer valuable practical contributions. 

<!-- Currently, I am in my third-year of my Ph.D. studies  where I am supervised by <a href="http://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=14&username=munk"><b>Axel Munk</b></a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical theory and statistical inference.  -->

Recently, I have been investigating statistical properties of **empirical optimal transport** and **entropic surrogates**. Selected works are outlined below; a full list of my publications is detailed <a href="https://hundrieser.github.io/publications/"><b>here</b></a>.
