I find it highly fascinating to model statistical problems in terms of mathematical language to obtain deeper insights but I also enjoy mathematics for its own sake. 

Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=home&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewmax.click&language=en">Institute for Mathematical Stochastics</a> at Georg-August-University Göttingen where I am supervised by <a href="http://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=14&username=munk">Axel Munk</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical theory and statistical inference. 

Recently, I have been investigating statistical properties of the intriguing subject on **optimal transport**. Selected works are outlined below. A full list of my publications is outlined <a href="https://hundrieser.github.io/publications/">here</a>. 

If you seek to contact me, you can reach me via email under "s[dot]hundrieser[at]math[dot]uni-goettingen[dot]de".
