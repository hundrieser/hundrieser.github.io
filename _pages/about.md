I find it fascinating to use mathematics for the description of statistical problems in order to obtain deep insights, but I also enjoy mathematics for its own sake. 

Currently, I in my third-year of my Ph.D. studies  where I am supervised by <a href="http://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=14&username=munk"><b>Axel Munk</b></a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical theory and statistical inference. 

Recently, I have been investigating statistical properties of the intriguing subject on **optimal transport**. Selected works are outlined below; a full list of my publications is detailed <a href="https://hundrieser.github.io/publications/"><b>here</b></a>. 

If you seek to contact me, you can reach me via email under "s[dot]hundrieser[at]math[dot]uni-goettingen[dot]de".
